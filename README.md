# Dice Roller Which Needs A Better Name

When finished, this program will be a highly-versatile and powerful dice roller, inspired by the iOS app Dice Calculator. At the moment, however, it's in the middle of a major code rework, and will likely require a lot more restructuring before it's worth using for most people.

Planned features:

- Cross-platform support, both for GUI and for CLI.
- Freely mix dice rolls with mathematical operations, with inputs such as (for example) `(5d9 + 8d6) * 2` being supported.
